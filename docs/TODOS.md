# FigmaikR Development TODOs

## 🚀 MIGRATED TO NEW STRUCTURE

This file has been migrated to a more focused, AI-friendly structure. 

## 📁 New Location: `docs/todos/`

The TODOs have been reorganized into individual, focused files that are easier for AI to process and implement:

### 📋 Active TODOs
- **[`docs/todos/README.md`](./todos/README.md)** - Overview and priority management
- **[`docs/todos/bridge-system.md`](./todos/bridge-system.md)** - Tailwind-Figma JSON Bridge System (High Priority)
- **[`docs/todos/visual-design-generator.md`](./todos/visual-design-generator.md)** - Visual Design System Generator (High Priority)
- **[`docs/todos/component-generator.md`](./todos/component-generator.md)** - Figma-to-React Component Generator (High Priority)

### ✅ Completed TODOs
- **[`docs/todos/completed/animation-system.md`](./todos/completed/animation-system.md)** - Animation System Enhancement (v0.3.0)
- **[`docs/todos/completed/typescript-definitions.md`](./todos/completed/typescript-definitions.md)** - Enhanced TypeScript Definitions (v0.3.0)

## 🎯 Benefits of New Structure

1. **AI-Friendly**: Each TODO is focused and actionable
2. **Parallel Development**: Multiple TODOs can be worked on simultaneously  
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Easy to understand prerequisites
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress through file organization
5. **Reusable Templates**: Consistent structure for all TODOs

## 🤖 AI Integration

The new structure works seamlessly with the AI development workflow:

```bash
# AI automatically selects and implements next high-priority TODO
pnpm ai:feature

# Or specify a specific TODO
pnpm ai:feature bridge-system.md

# AI handles complete release cycle
pnpm ai:release
```

## 📊 Migration Benefits

### Before (Single File)
- ❌ 279 lines, too complex for AI to process
- ❌ Mixed priorities and contexts
- ❌ Difficult to track individual progress
- ❌ Hard to work on multiple features in parallel

### After (Focused Files)
- ✅ Each TODO is 100-200 lines, AI-optimized
- ✅ Clear priority separation
- ✅ Individual progress tracking
- ✅ Parallel development support
- ✅ Consistent templates and structure

**Please use the new structure at [`docs/todos/`](./todos/) for all future development planning.**
